## Example Gameplay Scenario

Here's an example of a gameplay scenario:

```
****************************************************
*                                                  *
*          WELCOME TO THE ADVENTURE GAME!          *
*                                                  *
****************************************************

You wake up in a dense, dark forest. The air is damp, 
and you can hear the distant howl of wolves. In front of you, 
a narrow path splits into two directions.

What will you do?
1. Take the path to the left, which seems well-trodden.
2. Take the path to the right, which disappears into thick bushes.

Choose 1 or 2:
```

Player enters `1`:

```
You take the path to the left, hoping it leads to safety...
After walking for a while, you find an abandoned campsite. There is a lantern on the ground.
Will you take the lantern? (yes/no)
```

If the player chooses `yes`, they acquire the lantern and can use it in darker areas to avoid dangers. If they choose `no`, they continue without it, facing more challenges in the dark.
